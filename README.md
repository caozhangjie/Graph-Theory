This is the project of Graph Theory Course.

The document is "doc/document.pdf".

Our crawled data is in the "data" directory and the network is save in "data/network.txt".

Our crawler code is in "src/crawler" directory.

Our visualization is in the root_dir of the project.

The implemented algorithms are in the "static/js/algorithm.js". The implemented algorithms are introduced in the document. It's important to note that we implement the priority queue ourselves.

Front end instructions:

scale bar (the first grey bar): change the scale of the graph

edge weight threshold bar (the second and the third grey bar): the second tunes integer, the third tunes float number, this bar can threshold some small weight edge

algorithm selection: select algorithm

draw button: select or draw the algorithm as described in the "Result" section of the document

clear button: clear the previous algorithm's effect
